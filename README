Description

A very simple knowledge base application.  Stores data files with meta data to track entries and changes.

Plans for v1

*These are the plans I have for v1.  Just some simple stuff I would like to see completed before it is considered stable and ready for use.

1) Seperated config file 
	- assume default locatio of "../etc/kb.conf"
	- allow config to be passwd via command line "-x <config file"
	- config should support multipile data stores (v1 will not include full support)
2) Abstract the manegment of files and meta data to module/pm
	- use OOP in the modules to interact with KBINFO
	- proper implementation will ensure multipile objects can be loaded
3) Full command line support for:
	- creating new entry from <STDIN>
	- export an entry to <STDOUT> or file
	- list current entries
	- edit an entry
4) Be aware of userid (future would allow for multi user environment)
	- proper locking when editing
	- track user sessions connected to a Data Store
	- single user id (non-root) for ownership of Data Store
5) Error checking - currently assumes everything works. Very bad model
	- creation, delete, edit, etc...
6) Debug statements
	- standard modules for reporting DEBUG info
	- Allow debug data to go to file

Plans for v2

*Bigger grand ideas that may never happen

1) Fully abstract file/meta management
	- allow for other methods to store data DB, Network, etc...
2) Abstract the "engine" creating tiers
	- Tier 1: Data Store - currently file
	- Tier 2: kbengine - currently script
	- Tier 3: Presentation - currently single script
3) Security for users - multipile users
